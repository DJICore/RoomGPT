# RoomGPT
RoomGPT is a prompt for ChatGPT that allows you to use commands to generate room/game ideas.
It can expand on any ideas you already have, for example if you already know a name for your room, you can give it the name and it will generate a room based on that name.
Or if you have a basic description of what you want your room to be, you can give it the description and it will generate a name for it, expand on your description and generate tags you can use.
